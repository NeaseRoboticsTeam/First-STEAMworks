OK guys we had a great season. We're proud of everyone who contributed and learned from the experience. We're not updating this repo anymore, beyond the final version of the code I'm about to upload. In any case, if you don't want to stay bored until fall, you can help with the class file we're building for next year. Thanks guys.
